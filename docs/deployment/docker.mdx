---

Dograh AI can be deployed using Docker in two main configurations. Choose the option that best fits your needs:

- **Option 1**: For local development and testing on your own machine
- **Option 2**: For remote server deployment with HTTPS (using IP address)

## Option 1: Local Docker Deployment

For local development and testing, you can run Dograh AI directly on your machine using Docker with a single command.

### Quick Start

Run this single command to download and start Dograh AI:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dograh-hq/dograh/main/docker-compose.yaml && REGISTRY=ghcr.io/dograh-hq ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true docker compose up --pull always
```

This command:
- Downloads the latest docker-compose.yaml
- Starts all required services including PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, API, and UI
- Pulls the latest images automatically

### Access the Application

Once running (first startup takes 2-3 minutes), open:
```
http://localhost:3010
```

<Note>
You can disable telemetry by setting `ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false` in the command above.
</Note>

## Option 2: Remote Server Deployment

Deploy Dograh AI on a remote server to make it accessible from anywhere using your server's IP address. This setup includes HTTPS support via nginx reverse proxy with self-signed certificates. We need to serve the application over HTTPS, since modern browsers only allow microphone permissions for websites being served over HTTPS.

**We highly recommend you set up the platform on a fresh server, so that there are less chances of confliciting dependencies, and ports from other applications.**

### Prerequisites

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose installed. It should have minimum of 8 GB RAM and 4 vCPUs.
- Public IP address for your server
- TCP Ports 80, 443, 3478, 5349 and UDP Ports 3478, 5349 and 49152:49200 reachable from Internet (Port 80 and 443 to access the UI and rest of the ports for WebRTC Signaling)

<Note>Please refer to your server hosting provider's documentaion on how you can open these ports in the firewall of the server.</Note>

### Quick Setup

Run the automated setup script that will configure everything for you:

```bash
curl -o setup_remote.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dograh-hq/dograh/main/scripts/setup_remote.sh && chmod +x setup_remote.sh && ./setup_remote.sh
```

The script will prompt you for:
- Your server's public IP address
- A password for the TURN server (optional, press Enter for default)

It will automatically:
- Download the docker-compose.yaml file
- Create and configure nginx.conf with your IP address
- Generate SSL certificates
- Create an environment file with TURN server configuration

### Start the Application

<Note>
Please ensure that Docker Compose is installed on your machine before proceeding further. You can check whether its installed by running `docker compose version` command. If its not installed, please install it by following your server provider documentation.
</Note>

After the setup script completes, start Dograh:

```bash
cd dograh
sudo docker compose --profile remote up --pull always
```

### Access Your Application

Your application will be available at
```
https://YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

<Note>
Since we are using a self-signed certificate, your browser will show a security warning. You can safely accept it to proceed.
</Note>

You should be able to create and test a voice agent now. 

### Configuration Notes

- The remote deployment includes an nginx reverse proxy for HTTPS termination
- File downloads (transcripts, recordings) are automatically routed through nginx
- WebSocket connections for real-time features are properly proxied
- The setup uses self-signed certificates - browsers will show a security warning that you can safely accept for testing
- The TURN server (coturn) is configured for WebRTC NAT traversal
- For production deployments with proper SSL and domain names, see the [Custom Domain](custom-domain) documentation

### Files Created

The setup script creates the following files in the `dograh/` directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docker-compose.yaml` | Main Docker Compose configuration |
| `turnserver.conf` | Configuration for TURN server |
| `nginx.conf` | nginx reverse proxy configuration with your IP |
| `generate_certificate.sh` | Script to regenerate SSL certificates |
| `certs/local.crt` | Self-signed SSL certificate |
| `certs/local.key` | SSL private key |
| `.env` | Environment variables for TURN server |

### Next Steps
Now that you are able to create and test a voice agent, you can setup a custom domain and setup SSL using letsencrypt. Checkout [Custom Domain](custom-domain) for instructions on how to do that.
